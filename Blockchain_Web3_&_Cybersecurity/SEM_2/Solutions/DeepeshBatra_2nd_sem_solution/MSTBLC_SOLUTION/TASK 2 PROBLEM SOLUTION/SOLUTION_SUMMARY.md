- **Standard**: ERC721-compliant
- **Access Control**: Owner-only minting
- **Data Storage**: On-chain custom data association

### 🏗️ Contract Architecture
```solidity
contract CertificateIssuer is ERC721, Ownable {
    struct CertificateData {
        string recipientName;
        string courseTitle;
        uint256 issueDate;
        bool exists;
    }
    
    function issueCertificate(
        address recipient,
        string memory recipientName,
        string memory courseTitle
    ) public onlyOwner returns (uint256)
}
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage
- ✅ **Deployment Tests**: Contract initialization and configuration
